While some pets likely pose no problem, allowing dogs can increase the risk of property damage or injury. The law doesn't automatically hold landlords liable for dog bites. But, if a responsible tenant doesn't have enough insurance coverage, a dog-bite victim may decide to include the landlord as a defendant in a personal injury lawsuit."

The landlord, however, must mitigate damages by attempting to re-rent the unit.

If the landlord chooses to allow the animal to remain on the property, knowing that it could be a threat to the safety of all tenants and anyone else who may come in contact with the animal, some states may consider partial blame for any future attack to fall on the landlord."
msmarco_passage_62_725076102,"This liability is usually combined with the landlord   s ability to remove the animal.

Both models offer all the basics, including front-side airbags, curtain-side airbags, rear-side airbags, park assist, a backup camera, anti-lock brakes and traction control with stability control."
msmarco_passage_38_494076038,"Conclusions. The 2014 Range Rover Sport and the 2014 Range Rover are very similar SUVs, but they do have a few major differences. For many shoppers, price alone will eliminate the Range Rover from contention, as its $84,000 starting MSRP places it at the very highest end of the luxury SUV realm, while the Sport   s $63,500 MSRP is more reasonable."
msmarco_passage_38_494076531,"Other shoppers will choose the Sport for its smaller size, or its third-row seat     a feature the full-size model still doesn   t even offer. But for the few drivers who have to have the last word in the luxury SUV segment, nothing, not even the highly capable Range Rover Sport, compares to the full-size Range Rover."
msmarco_passage_38_494077936,"During the 2006 model year, Land Rover added the Range Rover Sport     which, because of its similarities to the Range Rover, can be difficult to distinguish from Land Rover   s original SUV. We   ve created the following list of differences between the 2014 Range Rover and 2014 Range Rover Sport to help you better identify and understand the two models individually."
msmarco_passage_38_494078439,"Exterior. Although the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport might seem similar at first glance, there are definite differences between the two. Parked side-by-side, there   s almost no confusing them, as the full-size Range Rover is significantly larger than its Sport stablemate."
msmarco_passage_38_494079263,"But the easiest way to distinguish the two SUVs is by their sides: The Range Rover Sport has a small grille mounted behind its front wheels, while the full-size Range Rover does not."
msmarco_passage_38_494079562,"The primary difference between the two today is that the 2014 Sport retains a sportier feel, with a higher center console and more interior curves, while the full-size Range Rover goes for a more dignified appearance, with a taller center control stack that gives the dashboard a wider look and feel."
msmarco_passage_38_494079979,"The full-size Range Rover also retains its pop-up circular gear selector knob, while the Sport uses a more traditional gear lever. In back, there   s an even bigger difference between the Range Rover and the Sport: the number of seats. While the all-new 2014 Range Rover Sport now offers available 3-row seating, the Range Rover still only offers two rows."
msmarco_passage_38_494080479,"Mechanicals. When it comes to mechanicals, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport have always been similar     and that remains true for 2014. Earlier models rode on separate platforms: The Range Rover Sport shared its underpinnings with the Land Rover LR3, while the Range Rover had its own platform. But that   s no longer true for 2014, as the full-size Range Rover and the newly redesigned Sport now use the same chassis."
msmarco_passage_38_494081062,"Under the skin, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport share virtually everything. The engines are the same: Both models use a 340-horsepower supercharged V6 in base versions, while Supercharged models offer a 510-hp supercharged V8."
msmarco_passage_38_494081789,"Features. As you might expect, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport both have similar equipment     and neither one skimps on the lavish luxuries. With that said, the Range Rover Sport   s base price of around $63,500 is far less than the Range Rover   s $84,000 starting MSRP, and in some cases, the reasons for that are obvious."
msmarco_passage_38_498013421,"What   s the difference between a Range Rover Sport and a Range Rover? The Sport is a midsize luxury SUV with the option of three seating rows. The Range Rover is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for five or, if the client wanted, a 4-seater arrangement."

Crawfish are an important food source for bass on most bodies of water and craw-patterns can be a great option to catch big bass. There are specific windows where craw baits will yield you the best results. What is the best time of year to fish with crawfish baits and lures for bass?
msmarco_passage_22_850848031,"In lakes with trout, big bass will be far from shore in deep water gorging on trout. In other lakes or rivers, schools of shad or shiners will be the ideal food source. The primary food source can also be bluegill and frogs in waterways that lack schooling baitfish or trout."
msmarco_passage_22_850848447,"Don   t present moving craw baits at these summer bass. Instead, try pumpkin-colored jigs with a soft plastic as the trailer. You can also fish with craw or creature-style soft plastics Carolina or Texas-rigged. Match the color of the water. If the water is clear, go with a pumpkin, brown, or green and black flake color."
msmarco_passage_22_850848937,"Early Fall. Early fall can also be a good time to try out some finesse craw baits In early autumn, many crawfish will molt their shells. For a brief window, they are protected only by a softer shell making them very vulnerable and ideal for bass. While these crawfish are vulnerable, they will not be out and about."
msmarco_passage_22_850849405,"They will instead be reserved and trying to hunker down near protective rock and logs. Moving red baits don   t make any sense this time of year so focus on creature baits, jigs, and craw plastics. Fish these baits in and around structure, rock, or logs."
msmarco_passage_22_850849803,"It should be noted that on lakes or rivers with schooling baitfish like shad, crawfish will very quickly take a back seat for bass. The bass will start heavily gorging on shad to fatten up for winter and start ignoring craws unless they are an easy target."
msmarco_passage_22_850850188,"Largemouth Bass. Crawfish do make up a substantial part of a largemouth bass   s diet. As bass mature and come into adulthood, their diet shifts towards larger prey items like fish, craws, and frogs. A 2009 study by Christensen & Moore shows this shift towards craws and other large baits as they mature."
msmarco_passage_22_850850648,"Focus on fast-moving crankbaits (lipless, squarebill, and deep-diving) in and around shallower cover, rocks, and grass. These bass will move into these shallower locations as water temps begin to warm. Once the schooling baitfish arrive in shallow water, smallmouth will shift focus away from crawfish."
msmarco_passage_22_850851091,"Smallmouth bass will still eat crayfish all summer long but more as a target of opportunity rather than the preferred prey. In summer, you   re best bet is attacking bass with brown, pumpkin, or green tube jigs, small creature baits, or soft-plastics. Go with a more finesse approach."
msmarco_passage_22_850851519,"In early fall, the crawfish bite will really start picking up again. You can really do well using jigs and tube jigs in early autumn.

msmarco_passage_22_850851981,"Craw Color Selection Guide. The most important thing to remember with colors for craw baits is to match the water clarity with the color. You obviously want a color that bass can easily see in the water. In very clear water, go with as subtle and natural colors as possible."
msmarco_passage_22_850852408,"While you can catch bass with craw lures all year long, late winter through early spring and early fall will be the best times to fish aggressively with craw lures. The key is focusing on times of the year when crawfish are most vulnerable and baitfish can be in limited supply for bass to choose. The exact type of lure you choose is less important than selecting a color of red or orange that will be ideal for the water clarity."
msmarco_passage_22_850852975,"Now if you start getting into murkier or stained water with less than 6 feet of visibility, switch to brighter or bolder reds and oranges. These colors will be easier for bass to pick up in less clear water. In muddy water with less than 1 foot of visibility, go with bold orange coloration."
msmarco_passage_22_850853407,"For finesse-style baits like jigs, tube jigs, soft-plastics, and creature baits, pumpkin, brown, and green colors work great in clear water. In dirtier water, you can   t beat dark blue or black as these colors will be easily seen in muddy water."
msmarco_passage_22_850853785,"Shallow Grass. In late winter and early spring, shallow grass is the best place to throw moving craw baits for big hungry fish. Lipless crankbaits in ghost or clear red color work phenomenally over shallow grass. Burn that bait fast and then add quick pauses in your reel turns."
msmarco_passage_22_850855121,"Craws can catch bass all year long, but throwing craw-style baits in late winter and early spring before baitfish start schooling up in shallow water will be your best bet. Fish clear    ghost    red baits when the water is clear and for muddy or stained water, selecting bolder reds or oranges lures will be a better option."
msmarco_passage_22_850856014,"Contrary to visual appeal, very realistic craw baits seldomly outperform crankbaits, jigs, or soft-plastics that are simply colored or loosely designed after craws. You will catch a lot more bass on a ghost red colored lipless crankbait in early spring than you will an incredibly realistic crawbait."
msmarco_passage_22_850856447,"That said, bass are bass regardless of what water they are stocked in. They are naturally programmed to eat crawfish if they see one. Even on lakes without craws, they will still attack a craw bait especially a fast-moving bait in early spring."
msmarco_passage_22_850857260,"This is the best time of year to catch bass using moving crawfish lures. Once water temperatures reach around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, start aggressively tossing red or orange moving lures. Lipless cranks, deep-diving crankbaits, and squarebills will be your best option depending on depth the bass are at."
msmarco_passage_22_850857705,"If the water is stained or murky, bolder reds or oranges can be a lot better. If the water is muddy, you will need something a lot more bold like orange or a very bright red. The trick is to move these baits fast along the bottom with sudden pauses in the cadence of your retrieve."
msmarco_passage_22_850988093,"Around the middle of June, big bass stop looking for large fish (trout, kokanee, big shad) to eat and start moving into the shallows with a focus on bank creatures and shallow water fish. From the middle of June through the end of August will be the best time to fish with frog lures."
msmarco_passage_22_851017148,"The best time of day to catch redfish is in the morning before the sun heats up the shallows and in the afternoon off in deeper water features like jetties, wrecks, and bridges. Redfish funnel back into deeper water in the afternoon because it is both cooler and holds more bait than the shallows. Tides also play a big role in the movement of redfish."
msmarco_passage_22_851635208,"Crayfish (Crawfish or Crawdads) as Bass Bait. When most freshwater anglers think of bass fishing with crayfish, they assume smallmouth bass are the targets. Smallmouth bass love crayfish. In fact, crayfish or crawdad or yabbies or crawfish depending on what you call them, are a favorite food item of smallmouth bass."
msmarco_passage_22_851689201,"Dark Clear Red for Clear Water, Bold Red/Orange for Stained Water. Craws are the best wintertime bait for smallmouth bass. Smallmouth bass really focus on crawfish in cold water. Red is the best wintertime color but match the red to the water clarity. In clear water, go for a darker red that has some transparency."
msmarco_passage_22_851693279,"I recommend you use a crawfish red pattern during winter. In clear water, go with a realistic red that is transparent with detailed shell lines. In muddier water, go with something like a bold orange or red that will be easier for bass to see. Crankbaits, lipless cranks, and squarebills work best."
msmarco_passage_23_510622897,"To catch bowfin, bait fish, including shad, minnows, suckerfish, shiners and small bream, fished live or as cut bait, work well. Bowfin also prefer crawfish, and can take frogs, salamanders and other aquatic animals.

Most of the Earth   s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries as the brittle plates slide and grind past each other as they move."
msmarco_passage_31_593526794,"Convergent plate boundaries are boundaries where two different plates smash into one another/converge on one another. The conversion of plates can happen between two oceanic plates, two continental plates, or an oceanic plate and a continental plate. The plate that is more dense sinks into the mantle in the subduction process."
msmarco_passage_31_602264711,"Continental vs. Continental Convergent Boundaries. When continental plates collide into one another, neither plate can subduct under the other because they are equally light and buoyant. Instead, they are pressed together under intense pressure. This pressure creates buckling and slipping, both vertically and horizontally."

msmarco_passage_32_480895803,Explanation: When two plate move towards each other they converge or come together. The collision between two plates that are moving towards each other is called a convergent boundary. When an ocean plate meets a continental plate at close to a straight line ( 180 degrees) the result is a subduction zone. There is usually a deep ocean trench off the coast of the continent.
msmarco_passage_32_480896333,There are numerous earthquakes along the line of the contact between the two plates where the ocean plate and its sediments are destroyed. The continent has mountains and volcanos that form along the edge of the continent as a result of the collision.
msmarco_passage_32_480896709,"When an ocean plates meets a continental plate at an almost parallel angle a convergent transform plate results, such as the San Andreas fault in California. The collision results in large damaging earthquakes. When two continental plates converge the result is the formation of large folded mountains. The classic example is the collision between the Indian plate and the Asia plate."

msmarco_passage_33_128698323,"Some plates run into each other. This can have different results based on which type of plates they are. As oceanic plates (plates under the ocean) run into continental, or other oceanic plates, they typically travel downward into the mantle. When continental plates collide with other continental plates, however, something else happens entirely. Continental collision occurs as two continental tectonic plates run into each other."
msmarco_passage_34_231297503,"Two Continental Plates. When two continental plates collide none is subducted as the plates are composed of the same less dense rocks that are kept buoyant. Instead of sinking, the plates wedge up to form mountains."
msmarco_passage_35_174658196,"The way one plate moves relative to another determines the type of boundary: spreading, where the two plates move away from each other; subduction, where the two plates move toward each other, with one sliding beneath the other; and transform, where the two plates slide horizontally past each other."
msmarco_passage_35_198020989,"When two oceanic plates converge, one plate subducts beneath the other. Generally, two features are formed: a trench, where the oceanic plates at the bottom of the ocean meet, and a volcanic island arc. This is because water being released from the subducting slab facilitates the melting of the overlying mantle."

Marx instead sees man as an objective, natural being who has real natural objects that correspond to his nature. Marx calls his view ""naturalism"" and ""humanism""."
msmarco_passage_18_687474867,"For Marx, nature is that which is opposed to man, yet man is himself a part of the system of nature. Man's nature is constituted by his needs and drives, and it is through nature that these essential needs and drives are satisfied. As such, man needs objects that are independent of him to express his objective nature."
msmarco_passage_19_600378659,"He is a believer in human freedom and human development. For Marx, the ""true realm of freedom"" consists in the ""development of human powers as an end in itself"".

msmarco_passage_19_863303212,"Communism portal. Philosophy portal. Socialism portal. v. t. e. Karl Marx's theory of alienation describes the social alienation ( German: Entfremdung, lit.

msmarco_passage_19_863328013,"Communism portal. Philosophy portal. Socialism portal. v. t. e. Some Marxists posit what they deem to be Karl Marx's theory of human nature, which they accord an important place in his critique of capitalism, his conception of communism, and his ' materialist conception of history '. Marx, however, does not refer to human nature as such, but to Gattungswesen, which is generally translated as 'species-being' or 'species-essence'."
msmarco_passage_19_863328647,"According to a note from Marx in the Manuscripts of 1844, the term is derived from Ludwig Feuerbach 's philosophy, in which it refers both to the nature of each human and of humanity as a whole."
msmarco_passage_19_863328959,"However, in the sixth Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that human nature is formed by the totality of social relations."
msmarco_passage_19_863330103,"Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [ menschliches Wesen =    human nature   ]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations."
msmarco_passage_19_863330863,"In Capital, in a footnote critiquing utilitarianism, he says that utilitarians must reckon with 'human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch'. Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life."
msmarco_passage_19_863331710,"In The German Ideology he uses the formulation: 'their needs, consequently their nature'. We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of 'tendencies', 'drives', 'essential powers', and 'instincts' to act in order to satisfy 'needs' for external objectives."
msmarco_passage_19_863333862,"So we can see that, even before we begin to consider the precise character of human nature, 'real, living' humans, 'the activity of man pursuing his aims' is the very building block of Marx's theory of history. Humans act upon the world, changing it and themselves; and in doing so they 'make history'."

[51] The aim of society, for Marx, is not the production of useful things as an aim in itself."
msmarco_passage_53_217844697,"The two sides of the relation are raised to a supposed universality; labor as a condition in which everyone is placed, and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community."". [55] Marx's whole concept of the self-realization of man can be fully understood only in connection with his concept of work."
msmarco_passage_53_217845164,"Man's potential, for Marx, is a given potential; man is, as it were, the human raw material which, as such, cannot be changed, just as the brain structure has remained the same since the dawn of history."
msmarco_passage_53_217845934,"In bourgeois society, capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality."". Here again, Marx follows the thought of Hegel, who understood labor as the ""act of man's self-creation."". Labor, to Marx, is an activity, not a commodity."
msmarco_passage_53_217846371,"Marx originally called man's function ""self-activity,"" not labor, and spoke of the ""abolition of labor"" as the aim of socialism. Later, when he differentiated between free and alienated labor, he used the term ""emancipation of labor.""."
msmarco_passage_53_217847208,"Marx's central criticism of capitalism is not the injustice in the distribution of wealth; it is the perversion of labor into forced, alienated, meaningless labor, hence the transformation of man into a ""crippled monstrosity.""."
msmarco_passage_53_217850259,"For Marx the process of alienation is expressed in work and in the division of labor. Work is for him the active relatedness of man to nature, the creation of a new world, including the creation of man himself. (Intellectual activity is of course, for Marx, always work, like manual or artistic activity.) But as private property and the division of labor develop, labor loses its character of being an expression of man's powers; labor and its products assume an existence separate from man, his will and his planning."
msmarco_passage_53_217851755,"For Marx the history of mankind is a history of the increasing development of man, and at the same time of increasing alienation. His concept of socialism is the emancipation from alienation, the return of man to himself, his self-realization. Alienation (or ""estrangement"") means, for Marx, that man does not experience himself as the acting agent in his grasp of the world, but that the world (nature, others, and he himself) remain alien to him."
msmarco_passage_53_217856285,"The alienated man, who believes that he has become the master of nature, has become the slave of things and of circumstances, the powerless appendage of a world which is at the same time the frozen expression of his own powers. For Marx, alienation in the process of work, from the product of work and from circumstances, is inseparably connected with alienation from oneself, from one's fellow man and from nature."
msmarco_passage_53_217863157,"Indeed, one can understand the concept of socialism only if one understands Marx's distinction between the true needs of man, and the synthetic, artificially produced needs of man. As follows from the whole concept of man, his real needs are rooted in his nature; this distinction between real and false needs is possible only on the basis of a picture of the nature of man and the true human needs rooted in his nature."
msmarco_passage_53_217863706,"Man's true needs are those whose fulfillment is necessary for the realization of his essence as a human being. As Marx put it: ""The existence of what I truly love is felt by me as a necessity, as a need, without which my essence cannot be fulfilled, satisfied, complete."" [93] . Only on the basis of a specific concept of man's nature can Marx make the difference between true and false needs of man."
msmarco_passage_53_217876236,"It is not an impoverished return to unnatural, primitive simplicity. It is rather the first real emergence, the genuine actualization of man's nature as something real. Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation. It is nothing less than creating the conditions for the truly free, rational, active and independent man; it is the fulfillment of the prophetic aim: the destruction of the idols."
msmarco_passage_53_218457851,"The concrete needs of men is the true middle term for Marx between nature and history. The possibility of having needs and satisfying them, that which makes men need-ful creatures, has its explanation in the physical environment of men and the biological structure of his body."
msmarco_passage_55_153266579,"As an idealist, Berkeley [wiki] believed that nothing is real but minds and their ideas. Ideas do not exist independently of minds. Through a complicated and flawed line of reasoning he concluded that    to be is to be perceived.   . Something exists only if someone has the idea of it."
msmarco_passage_57_288954218,It is the opium of the people (Contribution to Critique of Hegel   s Philosophy of Right). In the above definition Marx has stressed few points about religion which require special emphasis. In his opinion religion has been created by man to meet his own requirements. It is not the opposite.
msmarco_passage_57_288955139,It is like a sedative. Marx calls it opium. Religion helps man to forget the real world. Persons having vested interests use religion for the attainment of their parochial and limited interests. Marx makes all these remarks about religion in the background of the role religion played in all the periods before him.
msmarco_passage_57_288955620,Explaining Marx   s stand on religion Lenin says that religion is one of the forms of spiritual oppression. Religion is a weapon which blunts the sharpness of human intelligence and productive capacity of workers. ADVERTISEMENTS: He further observes that religion teaches man to be submissive and docile.
msmarco_passage_57_288957389,Marx has said that under the influence of religion man has no freedom to implement his full potentialities; he becomes the victim of religious practices. Man   s power and ability are limited and he does not possess the courage to challenge the religious practices according his own reason.
msmarco_passage_57_288957812,"Saint-Simon for that reason argued for their progress which would be able to remove the sense of fear and insecurity from the mind of man. We can, therefore, say that Marx   s idea of religion is linked with Saint-Simon   s thought on the same subject."
msmarco_passage_57_288959898,There are two broad aspects of Marx   s concept of religion. The advent and development of religion is due to the ignorance of man to understand the natural phenomena and their incapacity to solve his problems. When these two are overcome the importance and even the existence of religion will be in danger.
msmarco_passage_57_288961620,"Religion originated due to the ignorance of man about nature and natural phenomena. Marx, Engels and their adherents have concluded that religion will disappear with the progress of science and the application of science and technology to the development of society."
msmarco_passage_57_288962424,When science will meet all the requirements of society man will no longer resort to religious practices and adhere to religious beliefs and faiths. If the society reaches that stage the need for religion will decline. The impact of the progress of science and scientific knowledge upon religion has another aspect.
msmarco_passage_57_288963781,"It is the considered opinion of Marx, which he formed on the basis of study of history, is that man makes religion, but religion does not make man. In other words, religion is the self-consciousness and self feeling of man who has either not yet found himself or has already lost himself again."
msmarco_passage_57_288964652,"But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man, the state, and society. Religion is the general theory of that world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in a popular form. It is the fantastic realization of human essence, because the human essence has no true reality."
msmarco_passage_57_50023505,"This was the work in which he first noted that the nature of individuals depends on the material conditions determining their production, and in which he traced the history of the various modes of production and predicted the collapse of the present one (industrial ) and its replacement by Communism."
msmarco_passage_57_50024356,"Introduction | Life | Work | Books. Karl Marx. (Photograph, 1875) Introduction. Karl Heinrich Marx (1818 - 1883) was a German philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary of the 19th Century. Both a scholar and a political activist, Marx is often called the father of Communism, and certainly his Marxist theory provided the intellectual base for various subsequent forms of Communism."
msmarco_passage_57_50359671,Wolff thinks Marx's ideas about essences should be understood in terms of potentials. Marx's dialectical materialism was the idea that the world is material stuff and that humans make the world through their labor. Marx was very critical of religion. He thought it deluded the masses and distracted them from reality.
msmarco_passage_58_285515169,"We have biological needs like eating, sleeping, defecations; psychological desires like affection, stimulation, and conformity, and an assortment of other qualities and characteristics written into us by millions of years of evolution. Man as a 'species being' means that man has physical, mental, emotional, and other ingrained elements that are necessary for his survival, health and well-being."
msmarco_passage_58_285516305,"Man as a ' species being ' means that man has physical, mental, emotional, and other ingrained elements that are necessary for his survival, health and well-being. Marx contrasts this with the idea of ' social being ', which refers to artificial and constructed aspects of human existence."
msmarco_passage_58_285516724,"Man as a 'social being' means that human beings have built artificial physical and mental environments for ourselves to live in, above and beyond the natural environment that we live or lived in as a ' species being '. Marx makes this distinction to show one of the core issues in capitalism, that the capitalist class gets its power to exploit by constructing artificial environments (elements of our social being) that abuse natural limitations (elements of our species being) for the profit of the capitalist class."
msmarco_passage_58_489214495,"Machiavelli also says that human by nature are wicked and aggressive, in the words of Sabine,    Human nature is moreover, profoundly aggressive and acquisitive, men aim to keep what they have and to acquire more. Neither in power nor in possessions are always in fact limited by natural scarcity."
msmarco_passage_58_501133926,"If there's one which should have a definite meaning, it's Marxism, as that would be ""the theories of Karl Marx"".

The first was the idealistic, while the second was the materialistic. The idealistic phase is when Marx focused on human suffering, what capitalism as a structure does to society and how it creates a class divide etc."
msmarco_passage_60_709560524,"Karl Marx believed humanity to be capable of producing freely and creatively, overcoming the tyranny of immediate, basic needs that characterizes the rest of the animal kingdom.

msmarco_passage_61_257186772,"Aside from foreshadowing the work of Marx and later theorists of class relations and societal inequality, Rousseau   s conception of natural man is a key principle in all his work: man is naturally good and is corrupted only by his own delusions of perfectability and the harmful elements of his capacity for reason."
msmarco_passage_61_659615765,"Compare and Contrast the Philosophies of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Karl Marx   In the idea of human nature; origin of state, the nature of government, the rights of regulation can be drawn as the reflection of insightful philosophies of John Locke, Thomas Hobbes and Karl Marx."
msmarco_passage_61_664045201,"Marx argues that man becomes to be viewed as a commodity worth only the labor he creates and man is further reduced to a subsisting animal void of any capacity of freedom except the will to labor. For Marx this all leads to the emergence of private property, the enemy of the proletariat."
msmarco_passage_61_664046466,"The study on alienation in conjunction with the micro-study on Marx's view of freedom will help not only reveal why Marx feels labor limits mans freedom, but it will also identify exactly what kind of freedom is being limited. Karl Marx identifies estranged labor as labor alien to man. Marx explains the condition of estranged labor as the result of man participating in an institution alien to his nature."
msmarco_passage_62_805890530,"What Are Marxism Beliefs? Marxism is an economic and political ideology based on the ideas of the 19th century German philosopher Karl Marx. Marxists not only follow Marx's teachings on economics, but also on a variety of other beliefs about morality and history."

msmarco_passage_01_808242787,"This essay originally appeared in Consorting, newsletter of the Consortium of Vermont Composers. Since I first played oboe in a woodwind quintet at about age 13, I've been a fan. I love the richness of five distinct, heterogeneous voices that blend in innumerable ways, so unlike the insistent unity of the string quartet."
msmarco_passage_01_808244951,"The oboe and bassoon are both double reeds; the clarinet is a single reed; the flute has a sound-hole; the horn isn't even a woodwind, but just wandered in from sheer curiosity, and stayed for 200 years.)"

msmarco_passage_01_808246541,"The great virtue of the woodwind quintet is color, so mix your palette.

There are over thirty of them.)"
msmarco_passage_01_808247906,"What follows are some observations, some half-baked truths, some principles I try to follow but often can't. The standard woodwind quintet -- flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon -- first appeared in the late 18th century."
msmarco_passage_01_808252200,"Let's wrap this up, earthbound. Woodwind quintet, which really is a sort of miniature wind band, works nicely in combination with other forces. I particularly like voice (s) and quintet. The group goes well with piano, especially if the keyboard writing is percussive and motoric, to match the winds' attack."
msmarco_passage_01_808253080,"But don't think primarily in terms of limitations. The refinements in design and construction of woodwind instruments (achieved mostly by 19th century French builders), combined with the increasing demands made on players by 20th century composers, have produced astonishing results."
msmarco_passage_01_808253923,"We are a long way from the village band. The players usually sit in a semicircle: from audience left, it's flute, oboe, horn, bassoon, clarinet; sometimes horn and bassoon are switched; no array is sacrosanct. In score the order from top down is flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon."
msmarco_passage_02_729696383,"Again, Danzi did not experiment with different combinations of instruments and he  kept the pieces in common meters. If  Haydn was the father of the string quartet, Anton Reicha (1770   1836) is the father of the woodwind quintet. Reicha was a Czech composer who was active in all aspects of music in both France and Austria."
msmarco_passage_02_729697756,"Such was the state of affairs when I  conceived the idea of writing a quintet for a combination of the five principal wind instruments (flute, oboe, clarinet, horn,  and bassoon).

The woodwind  quintet is comprised of the four principal woodwinds from the orchestra: flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon; and one brass  instrument, the horn. Although most of the attention given to instrumental chamber  music is aimed towards the string quartet, the woodwind quintet has both a history and a collection of music that is worth  recognizing."
msmarco_passage_03_170840187,"In woodwind instruments, this vibration is made by either causing a thin piece of wood called a reed to vibrate, or by blowing across an opening in the instrument.

msmarco_passage_04_202973473,"Even so, many modern flute players use a metal body with a wooden head, feeling that it makes a much better tone than the all-metal instruments.

Some argue that a decreased appetite may cause the weight loss, whereas other evidence supports theories that the weight loss caused by this synthetic hormone in turn causes a counteracting increase in appetite as the body attempts to sustain sufficient weight."

Levothyroxine and weight loss are indeed correlated in that a common adverse effect of this drug is loss of appetite and weight. This medication is a synthetic of the hormone it strives to mimic     thyroxine. It is primarily used in the treatment of numerous thyroid conditions.
msmarco_passage_50_575322419,"Although both increased and decreased appetite are reported with the use of this drug, levothyroxine and weight loss are more strongly correlated than levothyroxine and weight gain.

msmarco_passage_59_208894633,"Before we talk about how Levothyroxine and Synthroid can cause weight gain we need to talk about some basic thyroid physiology. Your thyroid, under the influence of TSH (if working properly), pumps out primarily the thyroid hormone T4. What you need to understand is that T4 is an inactive hormone."
msmarco_passage_59_208895930,"Chances are high that you are dealing with 1 or more of them.

One of the biggest problems with T4 only medication is that your body may NOT be converting it to the active T3 thyroid hormone.
msmarco_passage_59_208898426,When you exercise you are only focusing on about 5-10% of your calories burned and it has little to no impact on your weight overall (this is why most of you who exercise aren't losing weight).

msmarco_passage_59_208899726,Because hypothyroidism is well known to cause a slow heart rate (5) or low pulse. (6) Your resting heart rate is a reflection of your autonomic nervous system which is mediated by norepinephrine and adrenaline.

msmarco_passage_59_208900170,"And that is true if you exercise daily and are not overweight at all, but if you do not exercise and you are 20+ pounds overweight your slow heart rate is NOT a good thing. Instead, it is an early indicator that your body is NOT burning an adequate amount of calories per day which may ultimately lead to weight gain."
msmarco_passage_59_208902691,"So yes, Levothyroxine can cause weight loss but it needs to be at the right dose and in the right individual. As a quick aside, if your Doctor isn't willing to add T3 or NDT to your regimen then you might be able to get him/her to prescribe Tirosint instead."
